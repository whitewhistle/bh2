Please read the report its way more detailed than the comments, the report has 4 aproaches in 12 pages you can skip to 9th page and read approach1 to save time .I did not do hyper parameter optimization seperately for tier 1 challenge.The hyper parameters are optimized for tier2 you can still run tier 1 by changing the function and dataset path.
